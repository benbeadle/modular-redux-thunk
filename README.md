A [ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux)-inspired package to help organize actions, reducers, and selectors together.

```
import { routerReducer as routing } from 'react-router-redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';

import { routerReducer as routing } from 'react-router-redux';
{

}

middleware.push(require('redux-freeze'));
```
